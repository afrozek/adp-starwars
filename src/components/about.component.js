                    <p>Created by Afroze Khan for ADP Pre-Interview</p>
                    <p>Thoughts: I am going to guess that this took me about 15 hours including the sketch design.<br/>You can checkout the github to see exactly how long it took me from my commits.</p> 
                    <p>I didn't get to fully complete what I had on my sketch design for the movie detail view, but I think did a solid job considering I had 3 days notice.</p>
                    <p>Also I didn't get to fully polish the responsive design.</p>
